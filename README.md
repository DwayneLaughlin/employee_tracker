# employee_tracker

This is an employee tracker using Javascript, the inquirer package from Node, and SQL. It would work as an application for adding and updating employee roles and keeping track of information like job titles and salaries. 

This app is only able to run in the CLI since it is not attached to any HTML based page. You can see it working at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-qeZ_3DVGGcCDVwU81PqdOtgKNm0m_uk/view?usp=sharing if you do not wish to copy the code and run it on your machine.
